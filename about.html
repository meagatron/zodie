                    ZODIE is the brain child of Aster Fairchild & Charles Croneos. Asters vast knowledge of Astrology and the Zodiac created the bases for the Zodie algerythm while Charles was the tech genius to bring Asters vision to life. Together they created the highly successful ZODIE dating app you see today.
                    <br><br>
                    Aster is happiest when she is supporting others to achieve their potential. Aster leads the Zodie team but knows that the real work is in the relationships that Charles builds with his creation the Zodie algorythm. Aster recognizes the value of having adults mentor and support her throughout her life and her career as she followed her dream to help connect those who are also passionate about the Zodiac. She feels many of her successes are due to having someone to turn to for help and wants to ensure others feel that same sense of caring.
                    <br><br>
                    Charles is the tech brain behind Zodie, with Asters passion he was able to create the Zodie Algorythm that matches users to other compatible users based on their zodiac. When he’s not working at Zodie, you can find him strolling around the chain of lakes in Minneapolis or searching out new restaurants and good food with his loving partner Stephan (who he met thanks to Zodie)!
